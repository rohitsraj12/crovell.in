								<p>Mahenra Mali, Director at Crovell, reveals, “Though Crivell is a new brand, the team have been in the mobile accessories industry for the past 2 decades and know ins and outs of this business thoroughly—from product management to sales and channel management. With smartphones usage growing rapidly, the demand for accessories is also growing proportionately. In general, a smartphone needs 3 or 4 accessories like adaptors, cables, car chargers, headphones, etc. There are very few accessory brands that sell across India; most sell in grey market without any specific targeted segment. Though 80% accessories are sold in grey market in India, we see a lot of scope still for new and white brands, as there is still a big gap in the market which needs to be filled. Our brand Crovell offers gadgets with latest technology with great quality. We are also going to provide accessories similar to those being provided by premium brand, but at a much lesser prices.”</p>
